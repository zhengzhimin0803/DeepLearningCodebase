# DeepLearningCodebase

## Description

This is a deep learning codebase for storing, sharing, and improving the code modules of my research and learning in the field of deep learning. These code modules cover various deep learning algorithms and applications, including (but not limited to) Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, etc.

## Project Structure
### dl-common
- create common dataloader
### NER
- https://github.com/doccano/doccano  to get platform to label sentence
- doccano command line
pip install doccano
```
# Initialize database.
doccano init
# Create a super user.
doccano createuser --username admin --password admin
# Start a web server.
doccano webserver --port 8000
```
In another terminal, run the command:
```
doccano task
```
